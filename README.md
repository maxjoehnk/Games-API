Games API
=========

The Games API is an API to create custom games for Minecraft.
It handles and manages all games, game instances, statistics, arenas and much more for you, so you can concentrate on the Game itself.
It works with Rules and Actions to create a game. There are predefined Rules and Actions but you can add as many as you want to create a new experience.
It has an integrated Wave Spawn System which works either with predefined Waves or a Pointsystem. Every mob has a predefined value of points and the API calculates a Wave with them.
